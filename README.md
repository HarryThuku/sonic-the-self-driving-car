# Sonic the self driving car
- Building a raspberry pi self driving rc car, may take a while, but i hope to learn a lot of stuff on the way.


# Force * Distance (Work Done)
- [x] Create a handler for the PS3 bluetooth controller
- [ ] Stream video from the raspberry pi to a web interface


## Contribution
- Right now you can contribute by giving me ideas on how you think the neural network for the self driving car should be designed & necessary hardware too.
